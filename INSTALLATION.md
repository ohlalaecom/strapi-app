Here are the steps to install and setup Strapi CMS:

1. **Install Yarn**: Yarn is a package manager for your code, allowing you to manage and distribute your JavaScript code. To install Yarn, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

2. **Use Yarn to Install Dependencies**: Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Create and Update `.env` File**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain environment-specific variables. Here's an example of what it might look like:

```dotenv
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
API_TOKEN_SALT=your_api_token_salt
```

Replace `your_jwt_secret` and `your_api_token_salt` with your actual values.

4. **Start the App**: You can start the app by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
yarn dev
```

5. **Publish the App**: For publishing the app, you should follow the official Strapi documentation. Here is the link to the deployment documentation: [Strapi Deployment Documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment.html)

Please replace the placeholders in the `.env` file with your actual data. Also, ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before installing Yarn.
